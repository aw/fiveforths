## Testing the implementation

One of my favourite RISC-V simulators is called [Ripes](https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes), it is open source and runs entirely offline from a single _AppImage_ file. It's perfect for testing and single-stepping through an ELF program and visually observing the registers and memory addresses.

### Log 5

I wanted to use _Ripes_ but I realized it would be easier to log output through GDB, so let's start there.

#### Loading the ELF program

First we'll want to load the ELF program into qemu:

```
qemu-system-riscv32 -machine sifive_e -kernel fiveforths.elf -S -s
```

In another terminal, we'll run GDB and ensure to load our program in QEMU.

```
Reading symbols from fiveforths.elf...
(gdb) target remote :1234
Remote debugging using :1234
0x00001004 in ?? ()
(gdb) info reg pc
pc             0x1004	0x1004
(gdb) load
Loading section .text, size 0x290 lma 0x8000000
Start address 0x08000048, load size 656
Transfer rate: 5248 bits in <1 sec, 656 bytes/write.
(gdb) info reg pc
pc             0x8000048	0x8000048 <_start>
```

That's better, but since the Assembly code is incomplete and we're not running it on the _Longan Nano Lite_, we won't be able to access memory at that address (0x8000048), so we won't be able to step through the program... unless I missed something?

You can confirm that it works in _Ripes_ where the first two instructions load `__stacktop` into the `sp` register and then the program stops.

There might be some relocation necessary if I want to successfully test this program in qemu/gdb, but for now this is acceptable until I physically connect the MCU.

#### Closing thoughts

This was a relatively short session with no changes to the source code, so in the next one I'll jump right into coding the missing words.
