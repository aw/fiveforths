### Registers list

The following _Forth_ registers are assigned to _RISC-V_ registers below. The source files also use additional registers such as temporaries (`t0` to `t6`).

| Forth name | RISC-V name | Description |
| :----: | :----: | :---- |
| DSP | sp | data stack pointer |
| W | a0 | working register |
| X | a1 | working register |
| Y | a2 | working register |
| Z | a3 | working register |
| FP | s0 | frame pointer (unused for now) |
| IP | s1 | instruction pointer |
| RSP | s2 | return stack pointer |

### Source files list

The firmware binary is built using `GNU as`, so all source files have the lowercase `.s` extension.

| Filename | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| [fiveforths.s](fiveforths.s) | Loads the actual source files from `src/` |
| **`src/`** |
| [01-variables-constants.s](src/01-variables-constants.s) | Some constants which are stored in Flash memory, but which may point to memory addresses to be used as variables |
| [02-macros.s](src/02-macros.s) | Macros to avoid repeating code throughout the source files |
| [03-interrupts.s](src/03-interrupts.s) | The interrupt initialization and handling routines |
| [04-io-helpers.s](src/04-io-helpers.s) | Helpers to send and receive characters over the UART |

| **`src/boards/<board>/`** |
| [boards.s](src/boards/longan-nano-lite/boards.s) | Variables and constant specific to the `<board>` |
| [linker.ld](src/boards/longan-nano-lite/linker.ld) | Linker script specific to the `<board>` |
| **`src/mcus/<mcu>/`** |
| [mcu.s](src/mcus/gd32vf103/mcu.s) | Variables and constant specific to the `<mcu>` |

### Memory map

The stack size is defined in `mcu.s` and defaults to 256 bytes for the `Data, Return, Terminal` stacks. The `Data` and `Return` stacks grow _downward_ from the top of the memory. The `Terminal` buffer grows _upward_ from the start of the `Variables` area. The `User Dictionary` grows _upward_ from the bottom of the memory. Currently `5` Cells are used to store variables. There is also an additional `64` Cells reserved for the `Pad` area, which can grow _upward or downward_. The `Pad` area is not exposed in _Forth_ and should be used exclusively by internal code or new Assembly primitives - as an in-memory scratchpad without affecting the other stacks or user dictionary.

### Word header

A dictionary word header contains 3 Cells (3 x 32 bits = 12 bytes). The `Link` is the value of the last defined word, which is stored in the variable `LATEST`. The `Hash` is generated by the `djb2_hash` function. And the `Codeword` is the address of the `.addr` label which jumps to the `docol` function.

```
+----------+----------+-------------+
|   Link   |   Hash   |  Codeword   |
+----------+----------+-------------+
 32-bits    32-bits    32-bits
```

### Hash format

The hash is a 32-bit hash with the last 8 bits (from the LSB) used for the Flags (3 bits) and Length (5 bits) of the word.

```
             32-bit hash
+-------+--------+------------------+
| FLAGS | LENGTH |      HASH        |
+-------+--------+------------------+
 3-bits  5-bits   24-bits
```
