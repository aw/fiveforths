It’s perfect for testing and single-stepping through an ELF program and...</p>

          <p>November 18, 2022 Validating the implementation I started this session by validating code that’s been written and ensuring things are where they should be. I’ve also created an TODO list to track my progress. Log 4 As mentioned previously, I defined some constants for the RAM size etc, but I’m...</p>

          <p>November 17, 2022 Deeper into the rabbit hole I spent a day reading some old Forth books and comparing my implementation with how things were presented. In retrospect, my early decisions weren’t as bad as I thought (except the 16-byte alignment). So I’ll account for that in today’s session. Log...</p>

          <p>November 14, 2022 Hello World This log serves as a memory dump for my thought process while working on my custom 32-bit RISC-V Forth implementation. The idea is borrowed from Dave’s NASM Forth where he meticulously logged his “dev nights” while working on his port of Jonesforth. How to follow...</p>
